				<h1>My Robotics Experience</h1>
				<p>In my sophomore year, I was the <span class = "red">programmer</span> of team <span class = "blue">750E</span> of South Brunswick High School.</p>
				<p></p>
				<p>Before the year started, we began to brainstorm strategies to approach this year's game, <span class = "red">Turning Point</span>. The following link describes our initial thought process. We prototyped our first drive design as shown below.</p>

				<p>I initially used PROS to program the bot's movement as we had V4 parts. The video shows the bot running an arcade drive.</p>

				<p>As time progressed, we added more functionality to our robot such as a 2 bar attached to a cap flipper to lift and flip caps. However, this design was extremely frail and had little stability. Furthermore, we concluded that attempting to score high posts was ineffective because of the time lost in precisely placing the bot in the correct position and scoring the cap for a mere 2 points. Descoring with a 1-bar or 2-bar seemed like a more effective option.</p>

				<p>At around mid-season, we decided to revamp and revitalize our robot, We added a roller intake with 2 vertical rollers to lift up the ball. The ball would then travel to a puncher with a linear slide. At this point, our bot was relatively more sturdy and reliable in matches. However, some adjustments had to be made such as changes to the height of the puncher and more points of connection.</p>

				<p>In the month of January, our bot had evolved. We added smaller wheels to the back to assist with getting on platform. We added mesh to the ball's path to ensure it won't fall out while intaking. We adjusted the power and height of the puncher with different strength rubber bands to acheive the optimal puncher power and angle. We attached more points of connections throughout the bot to ensure it was rigid and supported. At this point, we had <span class = "red">cap flipping</span> functionality, the ability to hit all <span class = "green">flags</span>, and <span class = "blue">platform climbing</span>. All in all, our bot was better.</p>

				<p>After qualifiying for <span class = "blue">worlds</span>, our bot had been through alot. I had to repair the left drive wheel, adjust the puncher and fix the vertical sprocket directly after states. 
				But after much deliberation, our team had come to the consensus that we had to rebuild.</p>

				<p>We made the switch to <span class = "red">VEXCode</span>, a text-only code environment for V5:</p>
				<iframe src = "code.html" width = "700" height = "700"></iframe>
				<p>The code is built with full optimization in mind. The User Control is a standard arcade drive with functionality for the rollers, angle adjuster, and launcher. There are 6 <span class = "green">autons</span>, each built with premade methods to drive forward using encoder values and turn using a PID loop from a gyroscope reading. The <span class = "blue">PID Loop</span> (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) is a feedback control loop system that allows the robot to calculate error from its destination and correct itself while turning, allowing for more precise turns and accurate autons. I also created an <span class = "red">auton selector</span> that will allow the user to choose which auton he/she would like to run before a match begins.</p>
