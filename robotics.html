				<h1>My Robotics Experience</h1>
				<p>In my sophomore year, I was the programmer of team 750E of South Brunswick High School.</p>
				<p></p>
				<p>In the beginning of the year, we began to brainstorm strategies to approach this year's game, Turning Point. The following link describes our initial thought process. We prototyped our first drive design as shown below.</p>

		<div class = "para1">
				<p>I initially used PROS to program the bot's movement as we had V4 parts. The video shows the bot running an arcade drive.</p>
				<img src = "" alt = "bot video">
				<p>As time progressed, we added more functionality to our robot such as a 2 bar attached to a cap flipper to lift and flip caps. However, this design was extremely frail and had little stability. Furthermore, we concluded that attempting to score high posts was ineffective because of the time lost in precisely placing the bot in the correct position and scoring the cap for a mere 2 points. Descoring with a 1-bar or 2-bar seemed like a more effective option.</p>
				<img src = "" alt = "bot image">
				<p>At around mid-season, we decided to revamp and revitalize our robot, We added a roller intake with 2 vertical rollers to lift up the ball. The ball would then travel to a puncher with a linear slide. At this point, our bot was relatively more sturdy and reliable in matches. However, some adjustments had to be made such as changes to the height of the puncher and more points of connection.</p>
				<img src = "" alt = "bot image">
				<p>In the month of January, our bot had evolved. We added smaller wheels to the back to assist with getting on platform. We added mesh to the ball's path to ensure it won't fall out while intaking. We adjusted the power and height of the puncher with different strength rubber bands to acheive the optimal puncher power and angle. We attached more points of connections throughout the bot to ensure it was rigid and supported. At this point, we had cap flipping functionality, the ability to hit all flags, and platform climbing. All in all, our bot was better.</p>
				<img src = "" alt = "bot image">
				<p>Our effort began to reveal itself with consistent elimination qualification and a variety of awards.</p>

				<h2>The following is the code at the time. We used VCS (VEX Coding Studios)</h2>

				<p>After qualifiying for worlds, our bot had been through alot. I had to repair the left drive wheel, adjust the puncher and fix the vertical sprocket directly after states. But after much deliberation, our team had come to the consensus that we had to rebuild.</p>
