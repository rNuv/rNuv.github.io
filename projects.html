Some of my creations include a PID Controller for our robot's autonomous routine, a UI for our Auton Selector using the LVGL Library, parabolic stacking and 2D motion profiling.</p> <br><br><br><br><br>

              <p>For Bloomberg, I had to present a project that utilized financial data and its visualization in some way. I created a web application using Flask for the back end and a static front end that would display a histrocial time series analysis, candlestick graph and news on a given company. The web app also has the Jupyter Notebook code outlined and also creates a correlation coefficient graph for the first 30 S&P 500 companies.</p>

              <p>Built with Raspberry Pi and Python</p>
              <p>For Science Olympiad, we had to create an electronic waterproof thermometer that would measure the temperatures of different water samples. I used a headless Raspberry Pi along with a breadboard using a thermistor. As the temperature on the thermistor changes, the voltage measured changes as well. By finding the correct correlation and converting the analog data to digital through a MCP microchip, you can use the thermistor as a probe that measures temperature.</p>

The courses include multivariable calculus and linear algebra, differential equations and complex analysis and modern physics. The PDF's are trophies of my efforts.

              <p>Built with Java and JavaFX</p>
              <p>My first game ever created with code was a remake of an Atari game called Defender. It's a quite simple game in which you control a spaceship to save your planet from invading aliens. But I remember spending so much time perfecting it to my satisfaction. This has held such a place in my heart that it deserved a spot on here.</p>

              <p>For one of our hacakthons, we created an fitness iOS application. Essentially, there would be QR codes at public places such as parks and using the app, a user can scan the code. Upon doing so, the user would get a list of execrises to do. Once the user does them, he/she receives a number of points tha could be used towards prizes. Although we managed to get a rudimentary prototype, we received second place in that hackathon.</p>
